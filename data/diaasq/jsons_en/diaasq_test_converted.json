Taking a night scene is much worse than the Honor . The most important thing is the Honor 30 series algorithm . The algorithm of Huawei is so much better even if it is not completely configured .

Huawei 's color algorith m is not pleasing . The Leica standard needs to be manually changed , and the Leica bright needs to manually raise the dark part and reduce the bright part . Personally , I think the most pleasing one is the blue factory x series AI algorithm . At this time , Zeiss is forced to close it , which is bright but not excessive . B: The m40p+ photo experience is too bad , but the advantage is that this periscope is too strong A: The camera experience is fine , stronger than most mobile phones . The strongest advantage is not the periscope , but the 1/1.5 - cun big bottom with an area equivalent to imx766 , 14 mm with free - form surface , which is 1 mm wider than the free - form surface of Green Factory . The extreme low - light shooting of this ultra - wide - angle lens is also close to the performance of the main camera , which is better than the main camera of many mobile phones , rely on it and the lower output , it is actually better than the Porsche version . B: I think the experience is really bad , taking photos is slow , the filming speed is super slow , the focusing is also average , and the AI recognition is very mentally retarded . C: Huawei 's image layout is early , and only photography does not include photography , but other companies have caught up with the layout of images at once .

I blindly evaluated , the result is , the first place in each group came from Samsung 21u+ , or x60pro+ , or mate40pro+ .

I do n't want to draw hatred , so I wo n't talk about the brand bug I used before , so as not to be scolded . B: I changed from mate20Pro to mate40Pro . It 's been almost four years with this two mobile phones . Except for the update , it has never been stuck or restarted automatically . So you have 10 bugs in three years and you still feel less . So what else can I think other than that you have super endurance ... C: Do you want to use my Xiaomi Mi 11 for you A: I mean my actual situation , I know there are many MIUI bugs . There is also a lot of feedback on the forum . But the bugs I encountered were really few . It 's not as serious as the one said on the Internet , MIUI is completely ca n't bbe used .

I wonder if other mobile phones of this brand can insist on shooting high - frame - rate video under the sun without reducing the brightness . C: OnePlus 9pro top version was purchased for the first launch . When I went to Disney to play in May , the system showed that there was a signal , but there was no network . No network lasted for more than 10 minutes . When I came back , I sold it . B: The camera is also , I have never seen you send a sample , what is the problem exactly at ? I was very dissatisfied with the over - sharpening and noise when it first released , but after a few months , it improved significantly . Sometimes the color is a little orange , and it need to reduce the orange saturation in LR .
