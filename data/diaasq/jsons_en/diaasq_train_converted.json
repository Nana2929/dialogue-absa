After using the phone for a few months , all three buttons are stuck , the charging is intermittent , and the battery is also very poor . Later , I decided to switch to Apple . After using it , I realized that the Xiaomi mobile phone is really garbage .

[ Pick your nose ] , 12p pictures are more comprehensive , and 11p pictures are more focused on the main camera ( and telephoto ) . The battery is regressing but charging is fast , the body is thin , and the wireless is flat is not a regress ( it ca n't progress ) . In addition , the screen is better , theoretically the battery life will be better ( with ltpo ) , the dual Yang is more powerful and looks better ( subjectively ) , and the 8g1 has better performance than the 888 ( there is no measured energy consumption , let 's not mention it ) . Buy a new one instead of an old one . C: 400 battery is not worth changing to ltpo , not to mention that the new 8 processor is a large fire dragon , strong heat dissipation means strong power consumption B: It can be seen on the Moto that the energy consumption of the Snapdragon 8 is better than 888 . Specifically depends on consumer feedback . D: Xiaomi mobile phones have gradually moved towards commercialization . Now the mobile phone industry has basically reached a bottleneck , and it does n't seem to be meaningful for fast charging to popularize 120W. I bought one after the release of CIVI , and I felt that Xiaomi mobile phone focused on the experience . E: It 's better to keep the system stable . F: First of all , the camera experience , the quality will definitely beat the 11Pro . The battery is smaller , but the new customization density is higher , and the battery life is definitely better than that of the 11pro ; wireless is not a step backward , it is a maximum of 50w , and he ca n't help it if he wants to increase it !

Android phones also have Android phone usage . After one or two years , you can replace one . In a few years , the cost is similar to using Apple . Of course , it is needless to say that rich people renew their apples every year . D: I 'm not talking about three to five years , , , , Apple will get stuck in five years .

On the one hand , the performance of the Apple A series SOC has been significantly ahead of the same year 's Android machine . On the other hand , Apple software updates better , the fluency of ios15 on old devices is unexpectedly improved compared with ios14 A: That 's true , but due to the suppliers change , profits , and strategic factors , Apple has produced some products only to increase iOS users , such as 5C , SE , XR , and 11 which I think is a pseudo - digital iterations and retrograde product B: But to talk about whether can nail , XR and 11 are definitely capable .

[ Allow sad ] all of them keep rushing to high - end [ Allow sad ] And then ... then consumers do n't buy it . B: Why does Huawei sell well over 5k ? Because under 5k is basically a suck phone A: It ca n't be said that , high - end success is that someone is willing to pay for its premium . For example , Apple has poor signal , small battery , slow charging , and poor Selfie . It can be said that Apple is not as good as Android except for the processor and system and record video , but it is Apple .

D: you 're right A: I personally feel that the most difficult thing to hit the high - end is to change the stereotypes of consumers and gain consumer recognition . You do not have enough strength to change the stereotypes in the market . For example , a young man riding a ghost fire calls himself a multi - millionaire in the village every day . Other people 's stereotype of him is that he is poor ... E: I think it 's mainly the chip screw up , is n't 888 and 8gen1 compared to A15 is industrial garbage .

    "input": "A: I am using the 11pro now , the last one was the xs , the last last one was the xr , I feel that the 11pro has a slightly stronger battery life than the xr , completely defeating the xs , and this one has been used for a year and a half and the battery is still 98 % healthy , very durable . In addition , I also ordered a 13pro 256 G , and I went to the direct sales store on the 25th to pick it up . I do n't have high requirements for the battery life of the 13pro . It is enough to reach the level of 11pro or xr , but not the level of xs , it will be too bad B: I use 12 pm , even with 5 g on , I do n't think it 's as good as 11pro C: At 12 pm , the battery life of 5 G is not that good , and it is much more stable if you switch to 4G. B: Yes , but when I do n't turn on 5 G , I feel like I bought the phone in vain . When Weibo loads the original image , it is obviously still 5 g faster , and 4 g has to wait for loading D: How much is the difference between 11Pro and 13Pro battery life [ DOGE ] A: Let me put it this way , since switching to the 13pro , the infinite charging pad on my desk has not been used , completely , because it is useless at all . I go to work from 9:00 to 5:00 pm , and I do not charge during this period , and my remaining battery has never been lower than 40 % . The battery life of this generation is very reassuring E: Awesome , I remember 11p is very small A: Yes , it is very small , the same size as the xs , with a 5.8 - inch screen , but the battery is very durable . The main point is that the thickness is about 0.4 mm thicker than the xs , and the weight is also more than ten grams . These sacrifices are to enhance the battery life . Of course , in the end The result is also very good",

You see , if this car keeps running at 120 kilometers per hour , you ofn course feel that it is smooth . Suddenly it changes to 100 or 80 . You can definitely feel it . The same for mobile phones . Assuming the optimization is very good , I do n't believe that going from 60hz to 120hz is not noticeable , unless this is done in a very short time , it ca n't be felt C: I do n't think you know what is LTPO B: Anyway , Android does not save power , and Apple 's is not smooth , just know the result , and they are not as easy to use as the global 120 . B: What I want to express is that the global 120hz is easier to use than the ltpo , it ca n't save electricity , my wife 's 90hz use not shorter than my 60 , especially when I look at the side head , OnePlus or what , anyway , there are several Androids , ltpo does n't have any power saving effect D: So , this is the gap between Android LTPO and Apple . Whether Android has this technology or not is high power consumption . But if you want to say the global 120Hz , it is too unfriendly to users . Android is poor in optimization , pure heap hardware , regardless of the optimization experience . A 4300mAh 13PM has a higher battery life than a 5000mAh Android , which exposes the prototype of Android 's LTPO B: So Apple is awesome , Apple 's power saving is due to system , processor , screen , and many reasons , not just one screen ltpo",

D: Because the redmi note 10pro is cheap , I bought it for me , but it was only three days after I got it , I was playing , and suddenly the screen went black for no reason . E: Mi 2S , Mi 5 , Mi 8 , I really think they are the three most successful mobile phones of Xiaomi . Mi 5 is still at my home . It feels so good and comfortable , however it is very hot , but there is no problem with playing games . Mi 8 Not to mention anything else , the battery life , I have been used for three years , and the bright screen is still about 6 hours . The point is that the MIUI12.5 problem has not been encountered . F: My Mi 8 did n't encounter the 12.5 bug , but the battery life ... The phone basically grows on the charging cable . E: I replaced a battery last year . The bright screen time dropped to about 4 hours before , so I replaced it , and it was over 6 after the replacement . G: 11 's wifi is mainly 888 heating and power consumption problem , plus the 11 series design is very thin . In addition , 11 's various configurations are very good , and it is the only one within 4000 that supports Dolby Vision H: Why does Xiaomi burn if other mobile phones do n't burn ? I: Nothing else burns ? It 's just that the sales are not that big .",

Now it 's 92 [ bitter ] To solve the problem of battery life , I have tried the back clip battery and it is not bad , but the charging logic is not very good , and it is too expensive .

You talk about 150w for a while ( there is no mass production at all ) , and then you say that the technology \" should \" still be there , which is a subjective inference . It is really not as convincing as the charging video of the dami test , and the conclusion of that video is that Xiaomi and Vivo is stronger than oppo .

It 's hard to say about charging now . The green factory does not produce 100 watts , it may be because they are afraid the temperature is too high to tarnish their brand . And it is also almost 150w .

At this frequency , the single - core performance of the large core is slightly stronger t han that of the 855 . Mid - core and 865 performance is about the same . It 's not incomprehensible that it gets sluggish in this case [ laugh cry ] C: Do n't say anything before you try it , just take a look at the evaluation and do n't take it seriously . No matter how bad the Mi 11 is said to be , my daily use is still better than the 865 Mi 10u . The 888 WeChat work software dual open will not drop a little frame , and the 865 will have obvious frame drop , If it were n't for the 10u 120w charging , I would have sold it long ago , and the Kirin 820 of Huawei nova7s e can not be used with dual - opening WeChat and dual - opening work software because it is too stuck . D: Any people say that the smoothness of Xiaomi 11 is not good ? Others say that it is not good , but they do not say that the fluency is not good . The power consumption of 8gen1 is obviously too high . The manufacturer locks the CPU frequency to ensure the battery life . So if many people say that the fluency of 8gen1 is not good , how can they advertise together ? Who are they advertising to ? E: X30 fluency is very good A: Maybe the simplicity of the native system is the reason for its smoothness E: You said that 8 mobile phones are all like this , and now you are talking about native F: I think it should be because the daily use of 8Gen1 scheduling is too conservative [ crack ] x30 seems to be much better E: The daily schedule of x30 is not much open .",

The previous 12 was not worthy of mentioning the battery life at all , and now the 13 is just qualified to mention the battery life . D: Structured light and ip68 are not used to compare , the motor above is at least a street better than Xiaomi A: The X motor is indeed , the size determines the feel of the vibration .

And then to upgrade the main camera , ultra - wide - angle and telephoto , then the price increase of 500 is inevitable A: Charging with its own 66W will not be scolded . It takes more than 40 minutes for the flagship model to charge 55W , which is really unacceptable in China . Only apple , which is arrogant and not afraid of customer loss , dare to charge 20W for ten thousand years , C: The X70 's photo upgrade is still very large , the glass lens has reached the level of some cameras A: The upgrade data is very large , but the actual effect is not obvious . I bought the x70p+ for the first launch . Compared with the X60P+ of my classmates in the night scene , the difference is not big , but the edge details are better . Brother Zhan also said on Weibo before that the expect for next - generation balance upgrade should not be too high . I guess it is also a squeezing toothpaste upgrade . D: Of course , there are fewer upgrades for two generations a year . Compared with the X60 super cup , the x70 super cup makes up for the shortcomings .
